# Collection of random scraping scripts

This repository is a host for non-connected scraping scripts. It is meant to be an example for both me, and others who want to do some scraping on their own.

## Current scripts

- [kodejobb.py](kodejobb.py) for [kodejobb.no/stillinger](https://kodejobb.no/stillinger)
  - This script scrapes the currently available jobs from Kodejobb, and formats them nicely such that they could be sent elsewhere using json.
